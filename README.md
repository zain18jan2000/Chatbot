# Chatbot
Chatbots are software applications that use artificial intelligence & natural language processing to understand what a human wants, and guides them to their desired outcome with as little work for the end user as possible. 

Unlike Generative based Chatbots, This chatbot is trained on predefined input patterns and responses. Hence it is a Retrieval based Chatbot. The Retrieval based Chatbots are widely used in the industry to make goal-oriented chatbots where we can customize the tone and flow of the chatbot to drive our customers with the best experience.
